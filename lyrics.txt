Cool - Dua Lipa

[Verse 1]
Guess I never had a love like this (Ah-ha)
Hit me harder than I ever expected (Ooh)
We been up all goddamn night, all night, all night (Ah-ha)
Keep it going till we see the sunlight

[Pre-Chorus]
And the colour of the sky looking nice-o-nice
You know, you know, you know
Baby, I could see us in the real life
You know, you know you got

[Chorus]
Got me losin' all my cool
'Cause I'm burnin' up on you
In control of what I do
And I love the way you move
We got the heat and the thrill
'Cause you're more than any pill
Never runnin' out of juice
When it's only me and you
You got me, you got me losin' all my cool
I guess we're ready for the summer

[Verse 2]
I like us better when we're intertwined (Ah-ha)
The way you touch me got me losin' my senses (Hey)
Put your love with your lips on mine, on mine, on mine (Ah-ha)
You got me working up an appetite-tite

[Pre-Chorus]
And the colour of the sky looking nice-o-nice
You know, you know, you know
Baby, I could see us in the real life
You know, you know you got

[Chorus]
Got me losin' all my cool
'Cause I'm burnin' up on you
In control of what I do
And I love the way you move
We got the heat and the thrill
'Cause you're more than any pill
Never runnin' out of juice
When it's only me and you
You got me, you got me losin' all my cool
I guess we're ready for the summer
You got me, you got me losin' all my cool
I guess we're ready for the summer (Ooh, ooh)

[Bridge]
Skintight
I'll show you heaven, there's nothing better
I'll give it to you all night
You know, you know, you know
Got me losin' all my cool
Yeah, you like the way I move
In control of what I do
And my love makes you brand new

[Chorus]
Got me losin' all my cool (Woo)
'Cause I'm burnin' up on you (Hey)
In control of what I do
And I love the way you move (Hey, go)
We got the heat and the thrill
'Cause you're more than any pill
Never runnin' out of juice (Woo)
When it's only me and you
When it's only me and you (Hey)
I guess we're ready for the summer (Ooh, ooh)
You got me, you got me losin' all my cool (Hey)
I guess we're ready for the summer (Ooh, ooh)
You got me, you got me losin' all my cool
