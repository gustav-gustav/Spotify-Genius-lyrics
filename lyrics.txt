Pretty Please - Dua Lipa

[Verse 1]
Somewhere in the middle, I
Think I lied a little, I
I said if we took it there, I wasn't gonna change
But that went out the window, yeah (Gonna break, gonna break)

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

[Chorus]
Put my mind at ease
Pretty please
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty please

[Verse 2]
Exactly where I want me, yeah
Underneath your body, yeah
If we take it further, I swear I ain't gonna break
So, baby, come try me
Baby, come find me
Baby, don't wind me up

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

[Chorus]
Put my mind at ease
Pretty please
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty
Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so pretty, please
Every single night, I need your hands on me
When your kisses climb
Oh, you give me sweet relief
Made me feel so pretty
Would you help me out, please?

[Break]
Pretty
Pretty
Pretty
Pretty

[Pre-Chorus]
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

[Chorus]
Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so pretty, please
Every single night, I need your hands on me
When your kisses climb
Oh, you give me sweet relief
Made me feel so pretty
Would you help me out, please?

[Outro]
Pretty please
