Yada Yada - Anderson .Paak

[Intro]
Can't do it
Can't do it
Huh, and there it is, my wit's end
They brought me out my mind
You know I'm caught beside myself
Pissed off and shit outta luck
Hey, I've thought 'bout puttin' up
I don't have the time, oh, not today
(You know that's impossible)

[Chorus]
Does somebody got some shit to say?
You know what? Fuck it
Like yada yada
Oh, you know everythang (Can't do it)
But not today (Can't do it)
But not today

[Verse 1]
My one and only, closest homie, we've carried on for days
I wanna burn another one down, but I'll go off in a blaze
Yeah, I need to put it out
But I don't have the time, oh, not today
(You know that's impossible)
Does somebody got some shit to say?

[Verse 2]
Darker days were bound to come (It's what it seems)
Through eyes of Brenda's only son (All I could see)
When the dreams become reality (Could it be)
It's hard to keep a smile off the mug (Look at me)
Casually talkin' that global warmth
As if the temperature didn't blow out your perm
Our days are numbered, I'd rather count what I earned
My greatest summer was spent on festival runs in Europe
Chicken wings and sushi, I've gotten used to the perks
Narrowly escapin' the holy war on the turf
Turf, yes, Lord

[Verse 3]
Came a long way from them open mics at Leimert
Forgive me if I walk like I got a chip on my shoulder
Label tried to play me like I didn't do all the work
I found another way through the open gate and my purpose
Now I'm goin' crazy like (Right)
If they forget the dot, I'm chargin' double for the purchase
Lo and behold, my little one
I've been gone for far too long
If I ever take this life for granted, you showed me just how dumb
But the longer I stay, the less I'm paid (I don't have the time)
Oh, not today
(You know that's impossible)
