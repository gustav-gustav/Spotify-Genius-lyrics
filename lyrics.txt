Already - Anderson .Paak

[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
Say, I’m on, I’m on, 2am in the morn'
Still, I’m ready, even if I don’t go
Baby girl I’m still holdin' on since I popped out the hole
Still, I’m ready if I don’t go

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Said
I’m naked down to my socks, bitch, I’m Anthony Kiedis
All this Charmin I got, put that right to your sneezer
Ride around on my block, VTA 2K Teasey (2K Teasey)
Fuck the police, okay, back to my thesis
Hoes: don’t love ‘em, don’t treat ‘em, I just teach ‘em to stroke ‘em
Pass that over to LODEF, he gon’ pass it to Jose
He gon’ lend to Mikos, okay, bases are loaded
If she make it to Parker she MVP with the trophy
Like Eric Wright with the shotty, Curtis May with the fender
Flava Flav wit the clock, I had no time to play pitcher
You niggas acting like goalies, youse a hatin’ defender
I stay on Ps and Qs since the top of my sentence

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
And I’m ready if I don’t go
Don’t go, if don’t go
I’m ready, but don’t go
Don’t go, don’t
Motherfucker, I’m ready

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
They oughta know, they oughta see
How you feeling, Uhhh! That's that Master P! (It's that Master P)
Did you roll or make it mine (Make your mind up)
We stay whole and you can wind (You can wind up)
Pick on the floorda, they gonna pop that cola
Bitch niggas wanna roll up, bitch nigga here get rolled up
Slow motion watch me bend that corner (Bend that corner)
Slow motion let she give me more, muh
I can’t stand what you got
Girl your ass is Movado, I can’t help but to watch
Collard greens in my pot
All these clouds I think I finally see the top, and motherfucker

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I’m ready if I don’t go
I don’t go, I don’t go
I’m ready if I don’t go
If I don’t go, If I don’t go
Motherfucker, I’m ready
I don’t go
I’m ready
If I don’t go, If I don’t
Motherfucker, I’m ready

[Outro: SiR]
If you got a problem we can light it up
Light it up, we can light it up
If you got a problem we can light it up
Light it up, we can light it up
If you got a problem we can light it up
Light it up, we can light it up
If you got a problem we can light it up
Light it up, we can light it up
